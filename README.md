## Versions
### 0.1.0
Aim: Implement colour based object tracking of a single tennis ball<br>
Notes: The colour thresholds can be adjusted manually for other colours, but only one colour and one object can be tracked at once
### 0.2.0
Aim: Implement colour based object tracking of multiple tennis balls<br>
Notes: The program occasionally struggles to recognise objects in low light conditions
## Future possibilities
- Using the wheel motors and camera servos to follow objects
- Using OpenCV object tracking to track objects of different colours
- Using ML computer vision technologies to improve object tracking (e.g. in dimmer lighting conditions)
